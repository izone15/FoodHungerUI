Just replace your esx_status and esx_basicneeds. Then just drag & drop the UI and in cfg type start ESX_Healthbar.
For further questions contact me on discord KeN1cs#8277
This is bars for hunger,thirst,armor and health. If you get drunk an extra bar will show up beside them.
If any of you are using a cinematic script just put st = false on first and st = true on second.

I got full permission from original author of the UI.
